## Migration Strategy for Email Services

### Option 1: Migrate to SendGrid (Recommended for GCP)

```bash
# Install SendGrid SDK
npm install @sendgrid/mail

# Configure SendGrid API key
export SENDGRID_API_KEY='your-sendgrid-api-key'

# Update email sending code
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail'
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY)

const msg = {
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  from: 'sender@yourdomain.com',
  subject: 'Test Email',
  text: 'Email content',
}
await sgMail.send(msg)
```

### Option 2: Migrate to Mailgun

```bash
# Install Mailgun SDK
npm install mailgun.js

# Configure Mailgun
import formData from 'form-data'
import Mailgun from 'mailgun.js'

const mailgun = new Mailgun(formData).client({
  username: 'api',
  key: process.env.MAILGUN_API_KEY,
})

await mailgun.messages.create('yourdomain.com', {
  from: 'sender@yourdomain.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Test Email',
  text: 'Email content',
})
```

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Domain Verification**: All services require domain verification for sending
2. **API Migration**: Update environment variables and API calls
3. **Testing**: Send test emails to verify deliverability
4. **Monitoring**: Set up delivery tracking and bounce handling
5. **Cost Monitoring**: Track email usage to optimize plan selection
