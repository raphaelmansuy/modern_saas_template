### User Personas & Use Cases


#### Primary Persona: Sarah Chen - SMB Accounting Manager

**Background**: Manages accounting for a 50-person marketing agency processing 200 invoices monthly

**Tech Environment**:
- **Primary Tools**: QuickBooks, Gmail, Chrome browser, Excel for reporting
- **Work Setup**: Hybrid work environment with some remote work
- **Device Usage**: Desktop PC at office, laptop for remote work, mobile phone for on-the-go

**Pain Points**:
- Spends 15 hours/week on manual data entry from email attachments and web downloads
- Frequent errors in vendor name and amount transcription from PDF invoices
- Difficulty tracking expenses by project/client across multiple systems
- Manual reconciliation with bank statements and QuickBooks entries
- Time-consuming process of downloading invoices from vendor portals

**Web & Office Usage Scenario**:
Sarah receives invoice emails in Gmail and uses the Chrome extension to capture them directly. She accesses the web application from her office desktop to review AI-extracted data, makes corrections in the browser interface, and exports to Excel for project analysis. On mobile, she uses the PWA to quickly approve small invoices while commuting. The system integrates with her QuickBooks workflow, automatically categorizing invoices by project codes she sets up.

**Use Case**: Sarah installs the Chrome extension and bookmarks the web application. When invoices arrive via email, she clicks the extension to upload them automatically. The AI processes the invoices, and she reviews the extracted data on her desktop. For urgent approvals, she uses the mobile web interface. The system learns her classification patterns and becomes more accurate over time.


#### Secondary Persona: Michael Rodriguez - Corporate Finance Analyst

- Compliance requirements for audit trails and digital signatures
- Integration challenges with SAP and existing financial systems
- Managing invoice processing across global teams with different time zones

**Web & Office Usage Scenario**:
Michael uses Teams integration for collaborative invoice review sessions and automated approval notifications. He leverages OneDrive sync to automatically process invoices saved to specific folders. The web application provides role-based access for different approval levels, with Excel integration for bulk operations and reporting. SharePoint integration ensures all processed invoices are stored with proper metadata and version control.

**Use Case**: Michael sets up automated folder monitoring in OneDrive for incoming invoices. The system processes them asynchronously and routes them through Teams approval channels. He uses the web dashboard to monitor processing status across the organization, with Excel exports for management reporting. The system integrates with SAP for automatic posting of approved invoices.
