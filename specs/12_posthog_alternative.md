## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (1-2 weeks)

1. **Inventory Current PostHog Usage**

   ```bash
   # Export current PostHog data
   curl -X GET "https://app.posthog.com/api/projects/{project_id}/events" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

2. **Set Up Google Analytics 4**

   ```bash
   # Create GA4 property via API
   curl -X POST "https://analyticsadmin.googleapis.com/v1beta/properties" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "displayName": "SaaS App Analytics",
       "timeZone": "America/New_York",
       "currencyCode": "USD"
     }'
   ```

3. **Configure Data Streams**
   - Set up web data stream for Next.js app
   - Configure measurement ID and API secrets
   - Enable enhanced measurement features

### Phase 2: Implementation (2-4 weeks)

1. **Replace Event Tracking**

   ```typescript
   // Replace PostHog with GA4
   import { getAnalytics, logEvent } from 'firebase/analytics';

   const analytics = getAnalytics(app);

   // Track custom events
   logEvent(analytics, 'user_action', {
     action_type: 'button_click',
     element_name: 'signup_button',
     user_id: userId
   });
   ```

2. **Implement User Identification**

   ```typescript
   // Set user properties in GA4
   import { setUserProperties } from 'firebase/analytics';

   setUserProperties(analytics, {
     user_type: 'premium',
     signup_date: '2024-01-15',
     company_size: '50-100'
   });
   ```

3. **Set Up Custom Events and Parameters**

   ```typescript
   // Custom event tracking
   logEvent(analytics, 'feature_usage', {
     feature_name: 'advanced_search',
     search_term: searchQuery,
     results_count: results.length,
     user_tier: 'pro'
   });
   ```

4. **Configure E-commerce Tracking**

   ```typescript
   // E-commerce event tracking
   logEvent(analytics, 'purchase', {
     transaction_id: 'T_12345',
     value: 99.99,
     currency: 'USD',
     items: [{
       item_id: 'premium_plan',
       item_name: 'Premium Plan',
       price: 99.99,
       quantity: 1
     }]
   });
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation (1-2 weeks)

1. **Parallel Tracking**
   - Run both PostHog and GA4 simultaneously
   - Compare event data accuracy and completeness
   - Validate user journey tracking

2. **Data Quality Validation**

   ```bash
   # Query GA4 data via BigQuery
   SELECT
     event_name,
     COUNT(*) as event_count,
     AVG(value) as avg_value
   FROM `project.dataset.events_*`
   WHERE _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20240101' AND '20240131'
   GROUP BY event_name
   ORDER BY event_count DESC;
   ```

3. **Dashboard Migration**
   - Recreate PostHog dashboards in Google Data Studio
   - Set up custom reports and alerts
   - Configure automated email reports

### Phase 4: Production Migration (1 week)
