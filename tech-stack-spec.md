# SaaS Application Tech Stack Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines the recommended tech stack for building a scalable, type-safe SaaS application in 2025 using TypeScript and Bun. The stack prioritizes performance, developer experience, and maintainability, leveraging Bun's speed for development and runtime. It's designed for a typical SaaS (e.g., subscription-based tools with user dashboards, payments, and real-time features).

**Key Principles:**
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout for reduced bugs and better DX.
- **Performance**: Bun for fast package management, bundling, and execution.
- **Scalability**: Serverless/cloud-native components for growth.
- **Modularity**: Easy to swap components (e.g., frontend frameworks).

## Architecture Overview
- **Monorepo Structure**: Use a single repo with tools like Turborepo for managing frontend, backend, and shared packages.
- **Full-Stack Approach**: Frontend handles UI/routing; backend manages APIs/data; database for persistence.
- **Deployment**: Serverless for cost-efficiency and auto-scaling.

## Frontend

### Primary Recommendation: Next.js (with App Router)

- **Framework**: React-based with TypeScript, SSR, and API routes.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for components.
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, TypeScript-friendly).
- **Why?**: Excellent for SaaS with routing, SEO, and rapid development. Bun 

## Backend

### Primary Recommendation: Hono.js or Next.js API Routes

- **Framework**: Hono.js (Bun-native, fast web framework) for standalone API
- **API Communication**: tRPC for type-safe endpoints (optional, integrates with TypeScript).
- **Why?**: Hono leverages Bun's speed; Next.js API routes simplify if using Next.js frontend.


## Database

### Primary Recommendation: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational, scalable for SaaS data like users/subscriptions).
- **ORM**: Drizzle (type-safe queries, schema management; Bun-compatible).
- **Why?**: TypeScript integration prevents runtime errors; Drizzle is modern and fast.


## Authentication & Authorization

### Primary Recommendation: Clerk

- **Service**: User auth, sessions, and role management with TypeScript SDK.
- **Why?**: Easy integration, secure, and handles SaaS common flows (e.g., subscriptions).


## Additional Tools & Services

- **Payments**: Stripe (subscription billing, webhooks).
- **Email/Notifications**: Resend (transactional emails).
- **Monitoring**: Sentry (error tracking, performance).
- **Analytics**: PostHog (user behavior, A/B testing).
chatbots.
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub for collaboration.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Primary Recommendation: Vercel

- **Platform**: Serverless deployment with Bun support, auto-scaling, and edge functions.
- **Why?**: Seamless for full-stack apps; integrates with Next.js/Hono.


## Development & Tooling

- **Runtime**: Bun (for running, building, and package management).
- **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript rules.
- **Testing**: Vitest (Bun-compatible) for unit/integration tests.
- **Package Management**: Bun (replaces npm/yarn for speed).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing/deployment.

## Rationale & Benefits

- **Performance**: Bun's speed reduces build times and improves runtime efficiency.
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript + tools like Drizzle/tRPC minimize bugs in a SaaS context.
- **Scalability**: Serverless deployment and PostgreSQL handle user growth.
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, auto-imports, and Bun's DX make iteration fast.
- **2025 Trends**: Emphasis on speed (Bun), type safety, and AI-ready stacks.



## Implementation Notes

- **Getting Started**: Use `bun create` for project scaffolding (e.g., `bun create next-app`).
- **Security**: Implement rate limiting, input validation, and HTTPS.
- **Compliance**: For SaaS, consider GDPR/CCPA with tools like Clerk.
- **Scaling**: Monitor with Sentry; use caching (Redis) for high-traffic features.
- **Customization**: Adjust based on app needs (e.g., add WebSockets for real-time).
